Console support (similar to GNU screen)

* Tested environment
  xterm-377
  RLogin 2.27.7

* Build
  ./configure --with-gui=console ...
  make
  sudo make install

* Configuration
  Configuration of console version is almost same as that of X11 version.

  <mlterm-con specific options>
  o console_encoding (--ckm)
    Encoding of the console where mlterm-con works.

    OPTION:  console_encoding  encoding
                    |              |
            xterm <=> mlterm-con <=> vim

  o default_cell_size (--csz)
    Cell width and height in pixel if mlterm-con can't get them by TIOCGWINSZ.

  o console_sixel_colors (--csc)
    The number of sixel graphics colors of the console where mlterm-con works.

* Start
  $ mlterm-con

  mlterm-con starts $libexecdir/mlterm/mlterm-con-server which works a daemon
  process, and connects to it.
  If it doesn't work expectedly, try to execute $libexec/mlterm/mlterm-con-server
  directly.

  If a console window where mlterm-con works exits unexpectedly, you can revive
  it by starting mlterm-con and pressing Ctrl+F3.

  If you want to split screen, press Shift+F1 (same as '$ mlcc exec hsplit_screen')
  or Shift+F2 ('$ mlcc exec vsplit_screen').

* Note
  o Install libsixel (https://github.com/saitoha/libsixel) in advance if you
    want to show graphics or emoji in mlterm-con.
  o Input method plugin modules for mlterm-fb are binary compatible with those
    for mlterm-con.

* Unsupported features
  o OPEN_SCREEN shortcut of ~/.mlterm/key.
    (OPEN_PTY, HSPLIT_SCREEN, VSPLIT_SCREEN etc are supported.)
  o geometry option
  o scrollbar
  o indic script
  o open type layout
  o DRCS
