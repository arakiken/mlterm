SDL2 support

* Tested environment
  Arch Linux
  MacOSX 10.6
  MS Windows 8 + Cygwin 2.10.0 / GDI (CC="i686-pc-mingw32-gcc")
  Haiku R1 Beta4

* Build
  ./configure --with-gui=sdl2 ...
  make
  sudo make install
  (sdl2 version and X11 version can coexist in the same directory.
   So you can install main/mlterm-sdl2 and inputmethod/*/*-sdl2.so alone by
   'make install-sdl2' to the directory where mlterm has been already installed
   instead of installing all files by 'make install'.)

* Configuration
  Configuration of wayland version is the same as that of X11 version
  except font settings as follows.
  Be sure to configure fonts before starting mlterm.

  o Font
    If mlterm is built with freetype (./configure --enable-anti-alias)
    and fontconfig (./configure --enable-fontconfig), mlterm reads
    ~/.mlterm/*aafont files and searches fonts with the use of fontconfig.

    If mlterm starts with --aafont=false option, mlterm reads
    ~/.mlterm/*font-fb files without fontconfig.

* Start
  mlterm-sdl2

* Note
  o If mlterm is built with SDL2 on MinGW (CC=i686-w64-mingw32-gcc etc),
    it uses win32 GDI.
  o Available scrollbars are "simple" alone.
  o You can rotate display by --rotate=right or --rotate=left option.
    ("rotate_display = right" or "rotate_display = left" in ~/.mlterm/main is
     also available.)
  o OPEN_SCREEN, OPEN_PTY, NEXT_PTY and PREV_PTY shortcut keys are
    Command+F1, Command+F2, Command+F3 and Command+F4 on MacOSX.
