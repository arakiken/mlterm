 This sequence devides sixel graphics image by cell(*1), and defines image
pieces as the glyphs of <Pcn+0x20+N>(*2) code of <Dscs> character set in order
from the top-left corner cell.

(*1) The number of columns and rows are calculated as follows.
 <columns> = sixel graphics image width / cell width (rounded up)
 <rows> = sixel graphics image height / cell height (rounded up)
 (Width and height include transparent pixels)

(*2) 0x20 of <Dscs+1> is next to 0x7f of <Dscs>, and 0x20 of 0x40 set
   which consists of 96 characters is next to 0x7f of 0x7e set which
   consists of 94 characters.

[Appendix]
<Original DRCS-SIXEL (rlogin 2.23.0)>
o The number of columns and rows of sixel graphic image are calculated
  as follows.
  <columns> = sixel graphics image width (+1?) / cell width (rounded down)
  <rows> = sixel graphics image height / cell height (rounded down)
  (Width and height excludes transparent pixels)

o The range of defining image pieces as font glyphs by DECDLD is
  <Pcn+0x20> - 0x7f of <Dscs> alone.
