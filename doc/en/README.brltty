  $ make
  $ sudo make install
  $ mlterm -v
    mlterm version x.x.x
    Features: ... brlapi

  <brltty with xw driver>
  $ export BRLAPI_HOST=127.0.0.1:1
  $ brltty -b xw -A auth=none,host=127.0.0.1:1
  $ mlterm

  <brltty with xw and espeak driver>
  $ export BRLTTY_SPEECH_INPUT=/foo/bar/fifo
  $ export BRLAPI_HOST=127.0.0.1:1
  $ sudo mkdir /var/run/brltty
  $ brltty -b xw -s es -A auth=none,host=127.0.0.1:1 -i /foo/bar/fifo
